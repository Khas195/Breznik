# Process Journal - Tung Cao

_This is the process journal of Tung T. Cao the programmer and narrative designer in the group. I do unserstand that a journal should be written as things happened not after. Nevertheless, it was written after all the events had happened. As such, this is not much of a journal neither a story but rather my own reflections and assetments looking back at them. __Well with all things, however, there is always an exception, an outliar if you will, and that would be the initial thought section.__ _

### Prelude: Before The final protype

For the final prototype for True story class, Me and Chris decided to work together on this one. One of the many reasons is that we had already decided before the semester even started that we were going to work together with Chris being at the helm. 

It was a logical decision since  Chris wanted to be the vision keeper for this semester and I, who was vision keeper for 2 previous semesters, was kind of worn out. I didn't understand the role of the vision keeper and most of the time, it seemed more like just project management. 

I wanted to focus more on game design and game programming on this semester and less on the managing people side of game development. 

Thus, me and Chris had a conversation about what the game should be and it was clear then that he wanted was an Open world Role playing game. Though we had a glimpse of the story we wanted to tell, The story about the grandma and Krstoslav. Said story would be combined with a simple combat gameplay (Sword fighting) to create the game. 

It was clear to me then that the game was lacking something important, something to make it unique. I believed we lacked a unique game mechanic. It was weird at the time, how can our game be  lacking of uniqueness ?. We had a very cool and unique story, not to say that a story about a child and his grandma had never been told before, but the context and the details are fairly our own.

I didn't understand. I felt that the game was lacking, boring if it didn't have its own unique gameplay but so is Zelda. Zelda has a unique story, sure, just like ours and its gameplay was pretty straight forward. It is basically you using your weapon to defeat some enemies in your path. So I didn't know why hitting enemies in Zelda felt different, as in a different experience, from hitting enemies in dark soul or the witcher. 

With that said, I did texted Chris and let him known, on the weekend, that the game was lacking said gameplay feature. Though, to be honest, I couldn't come up with any game mechanic or gameplay that is fun and unique to cope with our story and basic combat during that week, so I instinctually pushed the task of thinking of it to him, since he was the vision keeper afterall. It was one of those mistakes, as a game designer, that I really regret making.

### Initial Thoughts (Wednesday, 16th October 2019)
Just finished writing all readme files. It makes the bitbucket repository a better place to live in with all the readmes rather than the wasteland of code and resources. Though some of the readmes need to be look at by the whole team like Readme for the overview of the project, readme for the process, to do list, ...

Was trying to decide whether Hacknplan or Trello is a better choice. Trello can be linked with bitbucket rather easy. Cannot say the same for Hacknplan, however. At the end, I choosed Hacknplan cause it looks cooler.

Setting up the code documentation using doxy gen was rather easy. Though not all files are documented, I will do so as I have to touch them in the project. Rather dissapointing when I can't open the index.html file on bitbucket to view the code documentation. 

The project, overall, seem to be ambitious. The project has like 10 weeks left and I think atleast 3 weeks is needed for polishing. That leave us with around 7 weeks for production. The 3 big coding tasks, as I can imagine in my head, should be the combat system, the Quest system and the AI for the monster. I think the combat system, which should look somewhere like zelda, Breath of the wild or Pine, can be done in 2 weeks of time. The question system can be done in 1 week and the AI should be done in 2 weeks. Which leave me 2 weeks left to make all the other stuff like the Menus, in-game UIs stuffs, fixing bugs....

### Weekly Meeting #1 (Thursday, 17th October 2019) 

As the name suggest, this was the very first meeting we had since the forming of the group on the previous True Story class which was on a tuesday. 
We basically decided on the things needed for the first playtest. 
They were mostly basic game mechanics and game animations that was gonna be there regardless of the project such as combat system and some fighting animations. 
We also did all the technical stuffs such as naming convention, management tools, What everyone's jobs and roles was in the project. More can be read in the [To-do](../to-do.md).

Good news is, I had written most of the thing we discussed in the to-do file inside the project. 
Bad news is that I had written the to-do for only that meeting. I wish I had done more of those, now. I thought that with hacknplan as out management task, the to-do will be obsoleted. Whether it is true or not, I guess, can be seen in this "Journal" because only the first meeting was written based on the to-do and the others based on hacknplan.

### Playtest session #1 (Tuesday, 22nd October 2019)
Thinking back about it, I think it was unnecessary because it kind of defeats the goal of a playtest session which is to test certain gameplay elements. What did testing the combat system and some attack animations helped us with the design of the game. We all had certain expectations of what the combat should be or ought to be. Unless we introduced something new about said combat system, which we did not, there was not really any purpose of playtesting it. 

It is a good learning experience for future projects, playtests should have a purpose of actually testing actual elements in the game. Either it is a completely new elements or a combination of old elements that we want to see if it actually works .
