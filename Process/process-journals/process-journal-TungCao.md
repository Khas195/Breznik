### Initial Thoughts(Wednesday, 16 October 2019, 10:50 AM)
Just finished writing all readme files. It makes the bitbucket repository a better place to live in with all the readmes rather than the wasteland of code and resources. Though some of the readmes need to be look at by the whole team like Readme for the overview of the project, readme for the process, to do list, ...

Was trying to decide whether Hacknplan or Trello is a better choice. Trello can be linked with bitbucket rather easy. Cannot say the same for Hacknplan, however. At the end, I choosed Hacknplan cause it looks cooler.

Setting up the code documentation using doxy gen was rather easy. Though not all files are documented, I will do so as I have to touch them in the project. Rather dissapointing when I can't open the index.html file on bitbucket to view the code documentation. 

The project, overall, seem to be ambitious. The project has like 10 weeks left and I think atleast 3 weeks is needed for polishing. That leave us with around 7 weeks for production. The 3 big coding tasks, as I can imagine in my head, should be the combat system, the Quest system and the AI for the monster. I think the combat system, which should look somewhere like zelda, Breath of the wild or Pine, can be done in 2 weeks of time. The question system can be done in 1 week and the AI should be done in 2 weeks. Which leave me 2 weeks left to make all the other stuff like the Menus, in-game UIs stuffs, fixing bugs....
