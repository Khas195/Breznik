### First week

In the beginning, we started by forming a team of five and we went to the café to discuss what each of can and can’t do and what we are interested in making. Then Chris briefed us about the narrative aspects of the game and then we spoke about the areas in the terrain such as a village, Field and forest and the Chris told us to make the layout for each area. I got the task to make a layout for the field.
Later Tung makes a repository for our group and made all the necessary README.md files and when I went through this pippin bar method I realized how easy it is to handle the documentation in our repository. Then we were added into a HacknPlan board which I loved using last semester. So I made a list of all the tasks that I will have to do and told everyone else to do the same.
The project had 10 weeks left at this point but to make a game that looks visually pleasing and has good mechanics is not that easy which I got to know from my last semester project. Also, we need a few weeks, in the end, to polish the game too which would make it 7-8 weeks to work. So at this point, I was just waiting for the art lead to give an art style references.

---
### Second week

This week we spoke about what we would like to have in the game in more details and what were the core aspects of the game. We used the big board to categorize the feature and main aspects. Then we spoke about what the artists have to research about and then discussed about the play-test. Then Tung said that he could make the movement and combat system also Chris agreed to make a player character and its animations. Later we had a discussion as I thought the field was too complicated as the assets might be complicated to imagine so I asked if I had a different opinion
such as working on the village, therefore, I can make hard-surface models but Freddy didn't want to give up on the village as he felt comfortable with that area so, then later we discussed if the field is an important and useful part of the map and decided to cancel the idea of having a field. As most of the aspects were discussed we ended the meeting for that week.

---
### Third week

So this week we refined the big board concept. Then we were told to make the layout of the areas that we were working on. As the field is removed I have to make a layout for one part of the forest so I made a scene in unity as a grey box design. After that meeting, we took part in the play-test to test the mechanics that were made by Tung which gave us an understanding of what has to change or fix. So later we discussed a lot more about the aspects of the game that are very important for the game and the aspect that could be removed as they don't support the game in any way. 

---
### Fourth week

So this week we were discussing about everyone's tasks that have to be taken care of that when we spoke about what I would be doing this week. As I didn't have anyone to share the work with such as me working with Freddy or Sarah with their areas Chris asked me if its okay to just make a field I was very hesitant as I didn't know how to make a field design as most of the work will only be done with unity terrain tool to paint the field grass and remembered in my last project we tried it and realized the PC cant handle the unity terrain. Yet I aggreged as I did want to look like a person to deny the work I was given. Therefore the field is back in the game, I asked Chris if he has something in mind to have in the field. So for this week, I got a task from Chis to make a scarecrow and make a grey-box design of the field. Making the field iteration wasn't bothering me but making a scarecrow is almost the same as making a human model which I am not good at so I struggled and made two different scarecrow models but wasn't sure if it will suit the art style of the game the Chris has versioned.

---
### Fifth week

So this week we had a meeting in the game lab and we were all showing the work we did so I was showing the field design which needed a few changes as for Chris's opinion and also the scarecrow need manger changes and I was not sure if I can do that without me taking DCC class this semester.
This means I will have to learn something that I am not taking this semester and I was not interested in high-level modelling techniques. I was very eager to learn and do programming but unlike other teams, we had Tung who's programming method and skill was totally out of anyone in our classes league so I could work on programming. So Chris told to try and learn substance painter and Z brush for this week, make a barn model and rock formation models and I had to make a change in the work that I did in the fourth week.

---
### Sixth week

This week meeting was done in the game lab like usual where we were working on the game for a bit and played the game to see how the game feels at this point. Later each of us were showing what we did for that we so Freddy was showing his house model and Sarah was showing the test terrain that she had on another unity project then I was showing the models I made which were way better but still didn't exactly suit the games art-style same went for Freddy too. so we got a task to make some minor changes to the models and Chris told me to get used to the pipeline of 3D modelling. Then for the iteration, I had to remove the fences as Chris ask me to do it. So this week I was supposed to learn how to use Z-bush which was too had for me as I did have many ideas in the 3D model yet I learnt a lot in Z-brush over the time I worked.

---
### Seventh week 

This week I had to work a bit more with modelling where I was making the assets I was told to such as a barn, rocks, Tractor, etc. But we were way more tensed as in that day's evening we have to present the game on the second w. so we tried to put all the work together and get ready for the playtest. Later in the same week, we meet up and spoke about what we observed in the playtest and found some solutions to the current problem we had. Then we spoke about what each of us is supposed to do for the milestone presentation day. Then we spoke a lot more about the feeling of the game and what the game represents and that was all for that week.

---
### Eighth week 

This week we all combined all the work and got to know what each of us were speaking for the presentation. So my part was all about what I do, the references I used, the process I go through while doing my tasks and what I have done so far in the game so I made the slides that were needed from my side and sent it to Sarah and she combined it all and sent it back.
On the other day, we meet up and spoke a bit about the game loop and practiced to do the presentation.

---
### Ninth week 

This week I was just concentrating a lot on the milestone presentation and we did the milestone presentation on Tuesday where I got to know a lot of criticisms that some fellow classmates and the professors had. Which help our group a lot because I felt most of us were in a feeling that our game was good just by looking at the animation and not judging the game for its mechanics and user illustration. So after the presentations were over we had a team meeting where we spoke about what has to change and then when we were talking we realized Tung was better at Game management so we all decided that he should do the Games writing and so on. After that, we spoke a lot more about what we all should be done by the next weeks meeting and we all said we should have more than 4 meetings per week for better productivity. For this week I got the tasks to research on VFX in unity and find some good sound effects for player actions and later we all left for the meeting with a good note.

---
### Tenth week

This week was quite chill for all of us. I had to find some sound effect over the week which as easy so I found the sounds and cropped it and asked Chris to choose what he prefers, he liked some of the sounds but he asked me to find some better once. Then I was supposed to research on VFX for the game so  I made some VFX with some YouTube tutorials and showed it to him and he like some of them and asked me to make more of the necessary VFX. Unlike modelling, I liked making VFXs even if it was my very first time making VFX so I made some more with some extra layers. Then on Saturday we meet up together and spoke about the game's story and how to make it a complete game with UI, sound, cutscenes, Etc. Then this to make the game look unique we thought of an idea which is to make floating islands like how I did my diorama in the first semester. Which I liked a lot as it makes the game look very dreamy so we decided what has to be done and called it a week so a week can finish the sprint.

### Eleventh week

This week I felt like my role changed from 3D modelling to working on unity to make VFX and working with sounds. So after all that research and familiarizing myself with making VFX Chris gave me specific tasks such as making VFX for foot roll, jump, thrust, sword swing, etc. So I have a to work on making the VFX and finding the sound effects to match that which I did my best and felt like it matched the intended feel yet Chris didn’t feel the same when I asked him. He was stubborn with his ideas, as to how exactly the sound and VFX should feel and was never ready to changes. So I tried to work along and changed a lot so he somehow likes the feel of the effects at this point I was trying to make the feeling that he wanted as he is the lead for the project. Also, another thing I felt at this point was the project was all about how the art of the game should be but the game didn’t have any unique mechanics or a strong story which we should all have focused on from the beginning. Yet I don’t blame Chris for this decisions as he is a very good artist, not a really good game designer and also this is his first time leading a project so he doesn’t know the importance of altering according to play-tests which me and Tung learnt from our last semester projects, in the beginning, we weren’t able to make him understand about all this as he thought he thought what he did was right and wasn’t ready to listen to changes me or Tung was saying but after the review from milestone presentation, he understood his mistakes and started listening to us a bit more than before which gave me a hope this could be completed as it is indeed to be.

### Twelfth week

This week was quite calm as I was working only on VFX for the enemy deaths. So I was just looking up multiple concept arts of some birds hunting and shells cracking which gave me some ideas for some enemy death VFX. So I started with the one which I could picture very easily. The chicken death was simple as its just sprite explosion where I put white feather texture to make a feather explosion. Then for the crabs, I was planning to do something with bubbles but I ended up doing a cracked shell concept where the crab dies and the shells explode and fall off. Later that week Tung found a VFX to fit the slim so I was only working on polishing what I made for the rest of the week.

### Thirteenth week

This week's (sprint) task was just worked over 2 weeks as I got more things to be done after each task is over. So we started this week by giving out tasks where
I was supposed to make village props and find background music which I loved to do as I always wanted to work on the village side of the project. So I was more motivated than ever so I was making the one model after the other and textured them in substance painter and posted in discord to ask rest of the members' what they think about the models. This time everyone liked what I made so, I made a lot more and pushed it to Git. Later I was finding music for the background of the game. I found like 22~ music and push it to Git and asked someone to check it. Yet, later on, we all decided we should make the music ourselves so Chris played the music which his guitar so we recorded the music in the studio. Later Chris and Tung asked me to make the grandma's house which was supposed to be made by Freddy but it wasn’t done in time and there was no response from him due to his personal timings. So I made the grandma's house and thankfully Chris and Tung liked it so they asked me to make a broken house so we can place the music box. So I worked on the broken house and textured all the items I made in substance painter and made prefabs in unity and pushed it. This was a very fun week.

### Fourteenth week

This week was hectic as we all had things to do from other classes and we had to all work on the game to end up with a stunning game. Yet, we didn’t have extremely specific tasks so I made a wooden tower model and worked on the ruined house texture. This was fun then later I work on the grandma's house again where I modified the door by adding symbols that glow when the player picks up an item which gave a totally new look to the house. Later Sarah asked me to place all the props in the scene and make a prefab as lot of people were working on the main scene so I made a duplicate of the main scene and worked on that and make a prefabs of all the objects in one empty game object so she can drop the prefab and reset the position to 0,0,0. This point I was just doing some handy work and left the rest of the polishing to Sarah as she will have to finish some more changes which will be completed on Sunday and we were planning to make the final presentation on Monday together which should be fine according to the time we have left. That’s all from me for this week.

Final working week

### Over view

This semester was a complete learning experience for me. In the beginning, I join this group just because some of my friends are in the group without thinking about what I will be doing in the team. I was very excited to work with programming this semester and that also the reason I took game programming fundamentals class but this team already had Tung a 4-5 year experienced programmer which gave me no choice but to work on 3D modelling. So I had to learn a lot about Z-brush and Substance painter and the whole pipe-line. But somehow I think I learnt a lot about that during this semester. Also, I was making VFX this semester which gave me a lot of ideas about unity VFX graph and particle systems which I hope would help me in later semesters. Since the beginning, I wanted to work with hard-surface modelling which only happened at the end of the semester as some people were not finishing work I got that task which was fun to do and made me happy at the end. Also, I was a bit sad about making the wrong choice in this semester by choosing True story, I choose true story only because I wanted to work with my friends and I liked the professors who were part of this course. But, I later realized it would have been a fun and even better learning experience with I would have taken the game a week which would have strongly boosted my programming skill. I am still not regretting my choice for a true story as it was another learning experience and got to know about how some students threat a project. If I want to improve something this semester that would have been working harder on programming and getting some more core game mechanics concept that would be with me for future projects.
