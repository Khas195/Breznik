### First week

We formed a team of five and we went to the café to discuss what each of can and can’t do and what we are interested in making.Then Chris briefed us about the narrative aspects of the game and then we spoke about the areas in the terrain such as village, Field and forest and the Chris told us to make the layout for each area. I got the task to make layout for field.
Later Tung make a repository for our group and made all the necessary README.md files and when I went though this pippin bar method I realized how easy it is to handle the documentation in our repository. Then we were added into a HacknPlan board which I loved using last semester. So I made all the tasks that will have to do and told everyone else to do the same.
The project had 10 weeks left at this point but to make a game that looks visually pleasing and has good mechanics is not that easy. Also we need few weeks in the end to polish the game too which would make it 7-8 weeks to work. So at this point I am just waiting for the art lead to give a art style references.

### Second week

This week we spoke about what we would like to have in the game in more details and what were the core aspects of the game.We used the big board to categorize the feature and main aspects. Then we spoke about what the artists have to research about and then discussed about the play-test. Then ting said that he could make the movement and combat system also Chris agreed to make a player character and its animations .Also later we had a discussion as I thought the field was too complicated as the assets might be complicated to imagine so I asked if I had a different opinion then later we discussed  if the field is a important and useful part of the map and decided to cancel the idea. As most of the aspects were discussed we ended the meeting for that week.

### Third week

So this week we refined the big board concept.then we were told  to make the layout of the areas that we were working on.as the field is removed I have to make a layout for one part of the forest so I made a scene in unity as a gray box design.after that meeting we took part at the play-test to test the mechanics that were make by tung which gave us an understanding of what have to changed or fixed.
