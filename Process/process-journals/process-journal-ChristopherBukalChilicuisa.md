# Process Journal
### Christopher Bukal Chilicuisa

This is the journal of my experiances working on this project. The entries are semi-regular, attempting to log a summary of as many meetings as possible, supplemented with my own thoughts.
The entries were noted on a personal item, and will be transribed onto the repository after the fact.

This is the day where the process can arguably said to truly have started. On this day we were to present our third, and final game prototype, after which we would all vote on the availabe prototypes and 
the chosen ideas would select their team.

I should detail the idea I had. My concept was admittedly quite nebulous; it was more of a feeling accompanied by visuals and actions than it was a proper game concept. 
I am someone who prefers games with what I would call physicality, which is to say, a game in which the paler controls and contextual character or avatar, and that avatar 
serves as a conduit to the player's actions, and may interact with the world of the game. These are typically first, or third-person action/adventure games. A game which
allows me to jump at will (and gives me a high degree of control in this process) is far more likely to appeal to me that one that does not (notable exceptions being games such as _Dark Souls_, etc.).

Added to this is my preference for combat in games (or perhaps not '_combat_' per se, but a way to actively engage with the environment, such as in the game _Portal_), my concept was of a third-person game 
where the player would control a boy-like character from a small village with a certain number of characters to interact with, and a surrounding area filled with threats to combat. The tone was to be cheerful
and adventurous.

The problem which was not so clear to me then, but which is painfully obvious to me in retrospect, is that I had no clear ending, or even central conflict around which the events of the game would revolve.
This did not deter me, however, as I was excited to work on this immagined venture; though this leads me to my second fatal mistake. My main interest through working on this project was to dive deeper
into the pipeline of creating 3D characters, retopologizing them, texturing them, rigging them, and finally animating and implementing them in the Unity engine. I viewed the project through this lense, 
and that lead me to neglect much more vital elemnts concerning the project.

Nevertheless, Tung had already previously agreed to work with me regardless of what project I would come up with. And with them, Hariharan, Frederic, and Sarah had all decided to join.

As for the tasks to be assigned, my choices were thus: Tung, obviously would handle the code, as he is by far the most advanced among us in this respect, I would handle the character designs, modelling, 
and animation, Sarah would be resposible for the environment (as she had already stated that she was skilled in this area, and wished to work on it), and Fredi would handle the modelling of the houses (as
he similarly expressed a wish to do so). Hari was an uncertainty; I knew his personal preference would be to to programming, but considering that that position was already filled, and Tung's reluctance to 
work with another, I appointed him the position of modelling various hard-surface props.

The rest of the class was spent talking amongst eachother, with me trying to explain a more detailed conept for the game, and Tung going over the tools we would work with in the production.

## 17th October, 2019.
We held our first meeting the following Thursday. The point here was two-fold: go into more detail on the tools we had chosen to use (Hacknplan, SmartGit), also deciding on a nameing convention, and to
determine what we would do for the fast-upcoming playtest. We had less than five days to com eup with something playable, as a sort of proof of concept.

We decided the best way would be to do everything in graybox. Meaning, a rudimentary box-character with animations, for running, jumping, and attacking, with the environment also being constructed out of
Bare blocks.

Later, Tung would bring up a point concerning this early playtest which I agree with, which is that a playtest this early on in the production doesn't really serve any constructive point, as our ideas
aren't yet a t the level where we would be testing certain game design decisions.

## 22nd October, 2019.
We were introduced to big boards this class.
