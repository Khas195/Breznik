# Process Journal
### Christopher Bukal Chilicuisa

This is the journal of my experiances working on this project. The entries are semi-regular, attempting to log a summary of as many meetings as possible, supplemented with my own thoughts.
The entries were noted on a personal item, and will be transribed onto the repository after the fact.

## 15th October, 2019.
This is the day where the process can arguably said to truly have started. On this day we were to present our third, and final game prototype, after which we would all vote on the availabe prototypes and 
the chosen ideas would select their team.

I should detail the idea I had. My concept was admittedly quite nebulous; it was more of a feeling accompanied by visuals and actions than it was a proper game concept. 
I am someone who prefers games with what I would call physicality, which is to say, a game in which the paler controls and contextual character or avatar, and that avatar 
serves as a conduit to the player's actions, and may interact with the world of the game. These are typically first, or third-person action/adventure games. A game which
allows me to jump at will (and gives me a high degree of control in this process) is far more likely to appeal to me that one that does not (notable exceptions being games such as _Dark Souls_, etc.).

Added to this is my preference for combat in games (or perhaps not '_combat_' per se, but a way to actively engage with the environment, such as in the game _Portal_), my concept was of a third-person game 
where the player would control a boy-like character from a small village with a certain number of characters to interact with, and a surrounding area filled with threats to combat. The tone was to be cheerful
and adventurous.

The problem which was not so clear to me then, but which is painfully obvious to me in retrospect, is that I had no clear ending, or even central conflict around which the events of the game would revolve.
