# Research Questions

Throught his game I wanted to explore the playful nature of a child. The way they view the world, and their associative approach to many things.
I aimed to achieve this through a dream-like sense of not belonging to any specific time of place, anachronistic elements, fantastical creatures, etc.
I also aimed to capture the sensations of exploring and environment, and discovering objects whose story and reason for being there are not clear, and so
add a mystifying tone. One might run along a field and come along the carcass of a cow, in a small forest on might find a strangely ornate birdhouse, an
inviting cave, or any number of other elements.

We will see how successful we are.
